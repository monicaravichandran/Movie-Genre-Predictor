Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge, but under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit, and dignity in adverse circumstances.

He is an honorable, but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded, obsessive man. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy.

Bucho (Joaquim DeAlmeida) is a wealthy but casually bloodthirsty drug kingpin who rules a seedy Mexican border town. Bucho and his men make the mistake of angering El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas), a former musician who now carries an arsenal in his guitar case. Bucho was responsible for the death of El Mariachi's girlfriend and put a bullet through his fretting hand, making him unable to play the guitar. Bent on revenge, the musician-turned-killing machine arrives in town to put Bucho out of business, though he finds few allies except for Carolina (Salma Hayek), who runs a bookstore that doesn't seem to attract many readers.

Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge, but under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit, and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese Commandant Saito. He is an honorable, but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded, obsessive man. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. Unknown to him, the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by Warden and an American, Shears, to blow up the bridge.",Adventure Drama War ,252.10134175216228,195.3395422257275,4.5559589581680475,212.46059933407452,213.3684794672572,236.1465038845723,181.8205714285721,193.3405714285714,219.4895238095212,156.7823426573441,174.89117132867213,200.1687062937004,216.88268156424712,172.48379888268147,127.35977653631323,17.638679791539573,7.477707006367068,11.928199189344694,239.43770599868301,203.63348714568343,173.23599208965106,165.1096433289309,98.4200792602381,23.07133421400306,79.35016835016707,27.876094276092463,8.250505050505424,206.5397426192284,137.82967448902338,68.291445874338,160.36572890025658,132.00170502983792,92.17561807331656,242.0740402193797,243.0731261425957,246.95795246800446,135.1427174975575,33.675464320624954,8.570869990225248,111.97251585623819,80.5190274841451,35.212473572939096,203.60407239819003,139.81561085972842,16.813348416289998,242.86946107784541,195.40958083832336,59.65748502994048

He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II. But he's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart.

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only ""faggots"" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible.

""Grindhouse"" (a downtown movie theater in disrepair since its glory days as a movie palace known for ""grinding out"" non-stop double-bill programs of B-movies) is presented as one full-length feature comprised of two individual films helmed separately by each director. ""Death Proof,"" is a rip-roaring slasher flick where the killer pursues his victims with a car rather than a knife, while ""Planet Terror"" shows us a view of the world in the midst of a zombie outbreak. The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.",Action Horror Thriller ,221.10231391134582,211.00306662948967,191.2871480345763,8.914046121600535,8.07097933513181,7.698113207545674,188.36710909679226,14.400453221111649,21.359987050823893,197.1891405969049,190.817331895006,169.7900035958272,148.9925681255157,20.76507018992939,23.088356729973768,41.14722222221893,15.735648148151741,13.063425925924435,244.794134560089,237.6043703277789,223.63944795859527,160.77297668038366,154.82167352537815,138.51028806584276,60.32276657060353,49.763688760806176,41.427953890489405,94.65951147298374,83.35307179866794,68.1635825314584,122.58582089552193,117.31641791044737,103.36194029850799,99.66610169491548,14.949152542374234,14.276271186439686,163.22316684378305,69.38469713071203,57.25717321997942,190.2559456398641,122.79275198187963,91.81653454133631,35.545559400229834,70.23183391003458,78.97923875432511,223.94149659864013,158.96870748299256,141.73605442176887

Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again. Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an ageing Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served. VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation and deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration - and will remain a legend forever.",Drama Family Musical ,4.042533081282016,6.531568998101647,3.4293005671033328,242.88758438508674,228.55591429409432,99.5500440270028,235.08135168960936,204.0159574468041,85.42991239048878,232.13769035532738,181.1240482233481,72.20177664974504,30.151205557823246,16.415202288511793,10.298324478954754,223.09977116704636,152.31075514874013,59.03981693363869,202.78500000000147,116.82750000000004,45.168333333333365,249.22384219553948,236.15780445969227,135.50428816466612,67.29531388152083,22.08222811671165,10.127320954906523,209.48604427334118,193.3628488931657,99.35418671799751,179.82019230769203,164.10673076923013,77.36153846153887,61.83299595141705,56.940283400808156,30.18421052631609,145.29142185663937,130.650998824912,59.333725029377185,106.60050890585232,96.08269720101809,44.61704834605597,112.645070422535,52.5971830985905,14.963380281690533,167.76041666666652,78.76934523809555,27.702380952381255

One life path has him ultimately married to Elise, a depressed woman who never got over the unrequited love she had for a guy named Stefano when she was a teenager and who asked Nemo to swear that when she died he would sprinkle her ashes on Mars.
