    "# Project Summary\n",
    "Our project is to predict the genre of a movie based on the plot keywords, top 16 colors in the movie poster, the synopsis, and the plot keywords identified for each movie from IMDb. The correlations we drew based on these features are in Data Exploration of this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance of Project\n",
    "This is an important field to research and develop solutions in. Even in 2019, major companies, streaming platforms, and websites have people manually select the genres for each movie or take input from customers about which genre a movie belongs to. A lot of time and money would be saved the the genre-to-movie assignment process was automated. This is the field we explore in this project."

    "# Webscraping Code Summary\n",
    "This Jupyter File contains all the code we used to scrape our data. We webscraped 10 different sites that contain the top 100 horror movies in imdb for each genre.The total dataframe has 1100 observations representing each of the following genres: Horror, Western, War, Scifi, Action, Adventure, Crime, Romance, Comedy, Thriller, and Drama. From the scraping we included- Plot Keywords, Movie Synopsis, Movie Name, imdb id, poster image url, Movie Storyline,Genre Variations, and Genre. After receiving all the imdb id's we had to loop through all the id's in order to recieve the plot keywords and storyline. "
