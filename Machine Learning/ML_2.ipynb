This is because for each of the 1100 values in the dataset, we needed to loop over all of the 16 rgb values and do the calculations like that to compute lab distance. This results in over 17600 iterations - 1100*16 = 17600. Therefore we were not able to run this model."

    "We created 2 models- one using Euclidean and one using Lab Distance. We decided to use the Euclidean Distance model mainly because the runtime for the Lab Distance Model was really slow. The reason for this is mentioned under Model 2's description. We still decided to include the code in this file because we wanted to further display our knowledge of KNearestNeighbors and that we know how to pass in our own distance metric, and also we thought the lab function would give us a better measure to see how closely related the colors are.
